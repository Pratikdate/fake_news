<p id="description">Building a Fake News Detection API using RESTful principles involves creating an endpoint that receives a text input and responds with a prediction indicating whether the input is likely to be fake news or not. Below is a simplified outline of how you might structure such a project.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Text Classification
*   RESTful API Endpoints
*   Input Validation
*   Model Training Endpoint
*   Model Evaluation Metrics
*   Authentication and Authorization
*   Ethical Considerations

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>
